# Java-SSRS
Managing SSRS within a Java program

# What is this for
Needed to find a way to bypass the default SSRS web portal. This was a proof of concept to show we can manage SSRS subscriptions within a Java application.

# What do I need to run this?
This uses a PowerShell library created by Microsoft (https://github.com/microsoft/ReportingServicesTools)
You will need to install this on the machine that will be running the PowerShell script (https://github.com/microsoft/ReportingServicesTools#install)
